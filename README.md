This repository contains the **code, datasets, and results** for the paper:

**"AI for Quantum Software Testing" (submitted to IEEE, 2025)**

---

## üìù Project Overview

This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be applied to **test quantum programs**.  

The workflow includes:
- Generating quantum circuits (OpenQASM)
- Extracting important features (e.g., number of gates, depth, entanglement metrics)
- Training AI models to detect bugs in the circuits
- Producing results such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance

All experiments reported in the paper can be **reproduced from this repository**.

## üöÄ How to Reproduce

If you want to run the experiments yourself:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jameomrk-spec/AI-for-Quantum-Software-Testing.git
   cd AI-for-Quantum-Software-Testing
Add DOI badge from Zenodo to README
