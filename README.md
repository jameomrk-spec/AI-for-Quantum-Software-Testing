# AI for Quantum Software Testing

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results for the paper:

**"AI for Quantum Software Testing" (submitted to IEEE, 2025)**

The project demonstrates an AI-driven pipeline for detecting faults in quantum circuits:
- Circuit generation (OpenQASM)
- Feature extraction (gate counts, depth, entanglement metrics)
- Machine learning training and evaluation
- Results visualization (confusion matrix, feature importance)
